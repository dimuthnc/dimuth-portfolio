## Overview

In this post, I share how we designed a multi-purpose integration platform to connect storage systems, message queues, and REST APIsâ€”while enabling audit trails and replay capabilities using event sourcing patterns.

## Architecture highlights

- Apache Camel for routing and transformations
- Kafka topics as an immutable event log
- Outbox, replay, and dead-letter patterns

### Example Camel route

```java
from("direct:ingest")
    .routeId("ingest-route")
    .process(exchange -> {
        // enrich, validate, and normalize payloads
    })
    .to("kafka:events?topic=ingest")
    .log("Ingested event: ${body}");
```

### Replay strategy

1. Query events with specific correlation IDs
2. Re-publish to dedicated replay topics
3. Track replayed events and outcomes

| Capability | Detail |
|-----------:|:-------|
| Audit | Event sourcing with immutable log |
| Replay | Deterministic reprocessing via dedicated topics |
| Observability | Distributed tracing + DLQ metrics |

## Lessons learned

- Keep routes small and composable
- Prefer idempotent consumers
- Build observability from the start
