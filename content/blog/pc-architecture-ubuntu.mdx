If you are an Ubuntu user you often find a situation where you need to find the architecture of your PC to download most suitable version of a software. This quick post guide you to find that easily.

Open a terminal ( CTR +ALT+ T ) and type
uname -m

This usually shows the architecture of your OS.

Few additional things.

1. You can do the same by just typing uname -i
1. If it gives an output like ix86 where x is 3,4,5 or 6 then your OS is 32 bit
1.  You can also view Ubuntu architecture by opening System Monitor (search for it in the computer) and going in to tab System. (usually the first tab). But this is not available for Ubuntu 16.04
